Write which framework u used and what you found easy / difficult:

I choose Bootstrap to work with. 

I followed the steps of W3schools en adapted everything I came across en thought to be usefull. After 80% of the info, I came across "cards" and adapted some more. 

Then I added decks, groups, body's, footers, padding and margin, background,... To make the cards not stick together and have a balanced layout. I found some descent info about that on Bootstrap's website. 

Problems... 

I didn't find it very difficult, but I have the feeling that I created a million divs with info and started using comments in the html file at the end of the divs to be able to remember which one it is. 

So difficult: overview? I wrote a lot of extra stuff in the html, but perhaps I didn't do it very efficient since I followed the basic steps and kept on adding. I think it looks messy now. 

Easy: I like that you have names for the stuff you want to use and that it adapts to the screen size if you pick the correct ones. I am having more trouble writing the responsive resume in CSS from the previous assignment so I am loving today because I finished it and I think the result looks descent! :-)
