# Frameworking

## Assignment

From bootstrap to materialize, the world has lots of css frameworks, but what is a `CSS Framework`?

A CSS Framework is basically a great library of CSS properties applied to general classes.
It allows you to both create and fasten the UI for a website.

Get started:
- Create a repository in Github **Frameworking-FTW**
- Recreate the layout below (use whatever text and images you want), just respect the layout
- Try to get as close as possible without writing CSS
- Add a navigation sidebar to the left, with some dummy links in them
- Style the navigation bar using only the framework you selected
- Make the grid responsive and on mobile screens (< 768px) make sure the sidenav disappears completely.
- Include your chosen CSS framework in the repository's readme and describe what was difficult & easy with your chosen framework for this exercise.
- Publish your result

## Result 

[This is my result](https://tinevancorenland.github.io/Frameworking/)

I choose Bootstrap to work with. 

I followed the steps of W3schools en adapted everything I came across en thought to be usefull. After 80% of the info, I came across "cards" and adapted some more. 

Then I added decks, groups, body's, footers, padding and margin, background,... To make the cards not stick together and have a balanced layout. I found some descent info about that on Bootstrap's website. 

Problems... 

I didn't find it very difficult, but I have the feeling that I created a million divs with info and started using comments in the html file at the end of the divs to be able to remember which one it is. 

So difficult: overview? I wrote a lot of extra stuff in the html, but perhaps I didn't do it very efficient since I followed the basic steps and kept on adding. I think it looks messy now. 

Easy: I like that you have names for the stuff you want to use and that it adapts to the screen size if you pick the correct ones. I am having more trouble writing the responsive resume in CSS from the previous assignment so I am loving today because I finished it and I think the result looks descent! :-)
